### **Description / Rationale**
This repository demonstrates web-based implementation of <a href="https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything">Depth Anything: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Unlabeled Data. Foundation Model for Monocular Depth Estimation</a>. This project demonstrates 2 implementations:
1. Basic DepthAnything, which shows only generated depth ("basic" folder)
2. Interactive DepthAnything, which shows 3D model generated based on generated depth ("interactive" folder).

### **Instructions**
To use a DepthAnything example, copy the corresponding html file contents. To dowload and locally serve models download them from the link provided:
1. Small model: https://cdn.glitch.me/0f5359e2-6022-421b-88f7-13e276d0fb33/depthanything_vits14.onnx
2. Quantized model: https://cdn.glitch.me/0f5359e2-6022-421b-88f7-13e276d0fb33/depthanything-quant.onnx

To increase quality, increase the input image size, for example make it 1024px.
